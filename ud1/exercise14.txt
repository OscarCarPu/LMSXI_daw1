1.- How would you modify the structure if a book can have multiple authors?
Just by making the value of "author" be an array

2.- How would you add details about the publisher of each book?
I would add a value to book named publisher, that would be a object with name, phone, email, etc...

3.- If you were to inclue customers reviews for each book, how would the JSON structure change?
I would add a value to book named reviews, that would be an array of objects, each object would contain an object user with informatino about the writer of the comment, a text review, and a number puntuation of the book.
